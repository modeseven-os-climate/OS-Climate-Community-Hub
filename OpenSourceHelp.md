**ODH On-Boarding Videos on YouTube** [See the series here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8VBRDTElCWpneB4dBu4u1kHElZVWfAwW)

Covers many of the basics of using ODH, with git, code reviews and building pipelines. 

There is also a **Data Science Workflows** section of the operate-first website that covers a lot of these topics.
