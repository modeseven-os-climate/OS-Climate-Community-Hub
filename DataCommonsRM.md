# Data Commons 
## What is it?
Data Commons is the platform and infrastructure which manages data as code.  The components include data ingestion pipelines, metadata management, data access management, data extraction technology, and functionality that enables different data sources to be federated and linked together (e.g. using entity matching for legal entities and subsidiaries). 
- Leverages Open MetaData to ensure data sources are discoverable and shareable.  
- Supports different types of data pipelines (batch data, federated data, real-time streamed data) in data creation, storage, transformation and distribution.
- Supports “data as code” approach where the data pipeline code, the data itself and data schema are versioned so as to have transparency and reproducibility (time travel).
