 - Why Open Source? To overcome data & analytics barriers which block investments needed to meet Paris Climate Accord goals, we apply the community-based open-source approach that enabled major breakthroughs in Life Sciences & Tech (Human Genome Project, COVID Vaccines, Hyperledger, Linux OS).  Please see https://os-climate.org/about-open-source/
