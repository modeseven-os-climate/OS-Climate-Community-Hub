# **PCAF Sovereign Footprint Calculations**
What is it?
- PCAF defined Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 carbon emissions for Sovereigns in analogy to the GHG Protocolâ€™s definition for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Cities).  
- Team implemented a solution based on a pre-release version of PCAF methodology. 
- As of Q4 2022, that PCAF methodology is now in the public UN AOAS TSP V3 consultation per Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance launch [public consultation](https://www.unepfi.org/themes/climate-change/net-zero-asset-owner-alliance-launches-public-consultation-on-third-edition-of-target-setting-protocol/).
- Demonstrated that Open-Source best practices foster innovation and speed to delivery.  
- OS-C was an early mover in this space.
