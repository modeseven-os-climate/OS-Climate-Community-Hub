# **PCAF (Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials) Sovereign Footprint Calculations**
What is it?
- PCAF defined Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 carbon emissions for Sovereigns in analogy to the GHG Protocol’s definition for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Cities).  
- Linux Foundation’s OS-Climate publicly released as open source the Carbon Footprint Datasets for Sovereign Bonds, consistent with the 2nd version of the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry, a methodology published by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) on 14-Dec. 
- The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) is a global partnership of financial institutions that work together to develop and implement a harmonized approach to assess and disclose the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with their loans and investments.
- The sovereign footprint datasets, now available as a public good without restriction, include production and consumption emissions as well as intensity measures by country. Currently, the calculated data is available with history from 1990 until 2020/21. Investors around the globe can download the data and include it into their Scope 3 category 15 reporting. 
- The rapid release of these datasets demonstrates that Open-Source best practices foster innovation and speed to delivery and how OS-C was an early mover in this space.
